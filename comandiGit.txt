Git is a distributed version control system.

git init: initialize a git repository
git status: command to see what the current state of our project is
git add [nomeFile]: to tell Git start tracking changes made to the file, we add it to the staging area by using git add
		    After this command the file is in the staging area but not in the repository yet 
git log: as a journal that remembers all the changes we've committed so far, in order we committed them
git push -u(for remember) origin master: the push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready. Using this command we push
					 our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub). The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master 
git pull origin master: prende dal repo locale su GitHub i file e me li mette sul master
git diff [HEAD]: look what is different from our last commit [HEAD if we want the diff of our most recent commit]
git reset nomeFile: unstage files (after adding them to the staging area)
git checkout --<target>: with git reset the file is just not staged anymore but he's still there. With this command files can be checked
			 back to how they were at the last commit for <target>
git branch nomeBranch: crea un altro branch su cui posso lavorare e poi potr√≤ fare il merge tra questo branch e il master
git branch: to see the local branches
git checkout nomeBranch: per switchare dal branch corrente a quello specificato
git rm nomeFile: rimuove il file
git merge nomeBranch: merge your changes from the nomeBranch into the actual branch
git branch -d nomeBranch: cancella nomeBranch
